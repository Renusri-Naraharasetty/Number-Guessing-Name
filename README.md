Simple GUI Animation using Python & Tkinter

Hey there!  
This is a small personal project where I tried bringing animation into a basic GUI using Python’s Tkinter library.

## ✨ What This Is
This project is a simple animation created with Python’s built-in GUI toolkit, **Tkinter**.  
It’s not a complex game or an app — just something I tried to understand how visual motion works inside a GUI framework.

🧠 I know it’s simple

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** for GUI and animations
- **VS Code** for development

## 📂 Files
- `final.mp4` – A short screen recording of the animation in action
- `main.py` – Source code for the GUI and animation logic
- Any additional images or assets used in the UI

## Code:


<img width="1696" height="1888" alt="gui code" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a920626-bf34-4a75-b9fd-2f77cb439faf" />


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repo
3. Run the Python file:

         python main.py

## 🎯 What I Learned

Creating and organizing UI components using Tkinter

Basic animation techniques inside a Python GUI

Patience and the joy of figuring things out step-by-step!

## 🗣️ Feedback?
Feel free to open an issue or just drop me a message — I'd love to know how I can make this better!
